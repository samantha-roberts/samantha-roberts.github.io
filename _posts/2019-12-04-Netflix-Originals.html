<b><h3>Objective:</h3></b>

This Shiny App was created to help aide Netflix users in choosing their next Netflix Original show.

<b><h3>How I Created the App:</h3></b>

To create this app, I first web scraped multiple data tables from Wikipedia. These data tables were the Netflix original shows that became 
the content in my app. The data tables had information about each show, such as the number of seasons, the number of episodes and the genre
that the show was categorized as. The first tab in the app is where the user can search for a show that they might want to watch based off 
genre. The second tab allows for the user to see a list of shows based off how many seasons of a show they want to watch, and the third tab
is where the user can see a list of shows based off the maximum episode length (in minutes) that they want the show to have.
