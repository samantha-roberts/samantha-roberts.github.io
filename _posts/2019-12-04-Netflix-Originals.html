<b><h3>Objective:</h3><br></b>

This Shiny App was created to help aide Netflix users in choosing their next Netflix Original show. 

<b><h3>How I Did It:</h3><br></b>

In order to create this app, I first web scraped two data tables from Wikipedia: the Drama and Docu-Series tables. Both these tables contain only Netflix Originals. The "seasons" information was split into two columns for the app, the number of seasons
was put into one column and the episode length was put into another column. This allows the app user to select their next show based off either of those parameters.
The user can find a show they might be interested in by checking box(es) of various genres, typing in the number of seasons they want the show to have, or by selecting the 
maximum episode length they want to choose by.
