<h2><center>Description of the Project</center></h2>
<p>
  The Music Hall is a non-profit performing arts center located in Portsmouth, NH. Their passion is to inspire, educate and connect audiences through the power of live performances and on-screen programming. They aim to ignite creativity, purpose, and a sense of community. Their clients are the people of the Seacoast area. The Music Hall is comprised of two venues: The Historic Theatre and The Loft. This project focused on the performances for the Historic Theatre, which is an 895-seat theatre. Performances are artists from genres like Folk, Singer/Songwriter and Alternative. In general, audience member are people in their 50s or older, often referred to as the "white haired" crowd. The Music Hall is struggling with identifying artists that are within their range and that will be successful at their venue. Within their range means artists that book venues around the Music Hall's 900 seat capacity, and within their price range. The question that this project was trying to solve was can the Music Hall's artist selection be improved to ensure that they are booking more successes.
