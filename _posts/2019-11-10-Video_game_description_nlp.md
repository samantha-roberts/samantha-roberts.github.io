# Do Video Game Descriptions Help Determine a Game's Overall Rating?
**by: J.Roberge**

How do descriptions effect a video game's performance. Do high ranking video games have a more detailed description and 
most importantly, can this description be used to predict a video games performance? This analysis will utilize a previously 
curated dataset that has tokenized the description of 10,000 video games which were found on itunes. The issues going forward 
will be how to most effectively deal with an extremely sparse matrix and which type of model performs best on this type of dataset.
