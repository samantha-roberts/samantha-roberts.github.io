**Background**<br>
As Albert Einstein once said, “If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough”, and I believe this quote encompasses my goals as an analytics professional: to explain things simply. In my opinion, I believe this famous quote by Einstein is often misconstrued, for a simple explanation does not necessarily mean a lack of complexity, but more in line with being able breakdown complex ideas to a more granular state.  Through this decomposition of complex ideas, we can begin to more fully understand the world around us, and, at the risk of sounding pretentious, our place. I have chosen the field of Data Science because I believe that this young, optimistic field has the protentional help answer some of humanities most confounding questions.
