**Background**<br>
<img src="/images/frontsteps.JPG" width="400"/> I grew up in Lebanon, NH and have been located in Durham, NH for the last 5 years for my education. Lebanon is home to the majority of my family- which I love because I am able to spend time with my grandparents, cousins and siblings when I visit. My favorite thing to do when I am home is to take my dog Abe (in the picture to the left) to my lakehouse and throw the tennis ball for him. I love athletics and played throughout my whole life. In my undergrad, I played on the Women's Club Ice Hockey Team and served as Treasurer as well. My ideal Saturday night is to sit next to a fire and watch the Bruins play while eating Pad Thai. When I am not with family, friends, or my dog I enjoy being outdoors and reading in the sunshine.

**Education**<br>
<img src="/images/unhlogo.png" width="400"/> I began purusing my Bachelor of Science in Statistics and Minor in Spanish at the University of New Hampshire in the Fall of 2015. Throught my four years in undergrad, I was involved in Club Hockey, Intramurals, Buddies Without Borders, and Nourish UNH. Buddies Without Borders provided me with the opportunity to connect with international students through fun activities like gingerbread house building. Nourish UNH was a platform for myself and the other club members to peer educate about eating well through cooking classes and tabling events. The cooking classes were extremly enjoyable, both for those running it (myself and club members) and for those attending (fellow peers). We were all able to relax, cook and eat delicious meals while learning about the nutritional value behind each component of the meal. While participating in these clubs, along with various other social events, I received strong grades and was inducted into Pi Mu Epsilon (math honor society) the spring of my junior year (2018). In order to qualify for membership, I maintained a GPA above 3.0 and completed at least the equivalent of two semesters of calculus and two additional courses in mathematics. As much as I loved my undergraduate education, I felt that I had much more to learn and enrolled in the Master of Science in Analytics and Data Science program, which I started in May 2019 and will be graduating from in May 2020.
