**My Personal Philosophy:**<br>
As Albert Einstein once said, “If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough”, and I believe this quote encompasses my goals as an analytics professional: to explain things simply. In my opinion, I believe this famous quote by Einstein is often misconstrued, for a simple explanation does not necessarily mean a lack of complexity, but more in line with being able breakdown complex ideas to a more granular state.  Through this decomposition of complex ideas, we can begin to more fully understand the world around us, and, at the risk of sounding pretentious, our place. I have chosen the field of Data Science because I believe that this young, optimistic field has the protentional help answer some of humanities most confounding questions. 

**History:**<br>
I grew up in the small town of Milton NH (my high school class consisted of thirty people). All though my home town was small, my family was not: I am one six children. After graduating high school, I joined the United States Marine Corps. My time in the Marine Corps was special because I privilege enough to meet some of the most courageous and honest people of my lifetime. I spent six years in the Marine Corps, and although the Marine Corps gave me the opportunity to see Afghanistan, Morocco and several other places, I knew I wanted to pursue a career that was more academically strenuous.

**Academics:**<br>
After leaving the Marine Corps, I was completely unsure of the route I wanted to take in academia. To save money and resources, I enrolled in my local community college, and during my time at Great Bay I received an associates in education with high honors. After Graduating from Great Bay, I continued my academic career at the University of New Hampshire. While attending the University of New Hampshire, I fell in love with the study of Economics. Economics has a special ability to quantify how people and groups of people bring order to their natural surroundings. Although Economics was my first love, it was not perfect for me. Although economics is an amazing field, I often felt like it was brought down by old outdated theories and, to make matters worse, it was often governed by those who dare not question these old principles. After 3 years at UNH I graduated with BS in Economics with high honors. After attending seminar on Data Science, I quickly decided to pursue a career in Data Science. There is something special about the field of Data Science, its quick, agile and willing to pursue any route that leads to actionable results. Data Science, I dare say, is the wild west of academia. Data Science has a deafening pace, for it seems like every moment there is a new algorithm, method, and or tactic in achieving actionable solutions. To be a Data Scientists is to be a dedicated life long learner.
